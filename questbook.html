            <h2>What is a Quest?</h2>
            <p>A quest is a <strong>journey or mission undertaken by an individual</strong> to achieve a specific goal or obtain a significant object or knowledge. Quests involve challenges, obstacles, and adventures that test the abilities and resolve of the individual.</p>
            <p>In literature, quests are commonly associated with fantasy, where characters embark on epic journeys to find treasure, rescue someone, or fulfill a prophecy.</p>
            <p>Quests can be physical, mental, or emotional in nature.</p>
            <p>Quests can be simple or complex, and can involve a wide range of activities, from exploring new places to solving puzzles to battling enemies.</p>

            <h3>Elements of A Good Quest</h3>
            <p>The key elements of a quest are a <strong>journey, a conflict, and an object to attain.</strong></p>

            <p>Designing a quest is my favorite way of setting a goal and motivating myself to achieve them. A good quest should have the following elements:</p>
            <div class="lists">
                <ul class="nes-list is-disc">
                    <li>a journey</li>
                        <p><em>Typically involves travel</em></p>
                    <li>a conflict</li>
                        <p><em>Requires you to overcome obstacles or navigate a confrontation. Can be physical or psychological conflict</em></p>
                    <li>an object to attain</li>
                        <p><em>There should be a clear treasure or reward at the end of the quest to take back with you</em></p>
                </ul>
            </div>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What is a Questbook?</h2>
            <p>A questbook is a book containing a list of quests. It is an enhanced version of a bucket list, wherein every desire is written in a specific format that's tailored for questing.</p>
            <p>Additionally, each quest is illustrated with a little goal image that symbolizes the activity involved in the quest.</p>
            
            <h3>Features of a Questbook:</h3>
            <div class="lists">
                <ul class="nes-list is-disc">
                    <li>Desire:</li>
                        <p><em>The desire is the main goal of the quest. It is what you want to achieve.</em></p>
                    <li>Goal:</li>
                        <p><em> The goal is the specific details of the quest, such as where and when you want to achieve it.</em></p>
                    <li>Description:</li>
                        <p><em>A brief description of the quest, including why you want to pursue it.</em></p>
                    <li>Recommended:</li>
                        <p><em>Tips or recommendations on how to achieve the quest.</em></p>
                    <li>Link:</li>
                        <p><em>A link to more information about the quest.</em></p>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Every element is well-researched and clarified. Furthermore, each item is illustrated with a goal picture, and hyperlinked to the appropriate websites.</p>

                <h2>Quest Framework</h2>
                <p>In my life, I use this framework to coordinate everything I do under one narrative.</p>
                <p>In video games, particularly in role-playing games (RPGs), the terms "main quest" and "side quest" refer to different types of missions or tasks that players can undertake.</p>

                        <li>Main Quest</li>
                        <li>Side Quest</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
